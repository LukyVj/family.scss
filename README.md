#### Version [v1.0.8](https://github.com/LukyVj/family.scss/releases)

Family.scss is a set of **26** smart Sass mixins which will help you to manage the style of `:nth-child`'ified elements, in an easy and classy way.

## Installation

### Regular
- Clone the project
- `$ middleman` ( You don't use middleman ? Goto [https://middlemanapp.com/](https://middlemanapp.com/) )

### Alternative install
- `$ npm install family.scss`
- `$ bower install family.scss`
- `gem install family-rails` ([maintained by pzi](https://github.com/pzi/family-rails))

Family.scss on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/family.scss)

## Usage
First of all, you need to import Family.scss into your project. If you're using [eyeglass](http://eyeglass.rocks/) you can import it as such:
```scss
@import "family";
```
Otherwise import the [Family.scss source file](https://github.com/LukyVj/family.scss/blob/master/source/src/_family.scss).

Then you can use the mixins right away on your stylesheets.

Input :
```scss
ul li {
  background: blue;

  @include first(3) {
    background: blue;
  }
}
```

Output :
```sass
ul li {
  background: blue;
}
ul li:nth-child(-n + 3) {
  background: blue;
}

```

### Why only Sass ?
It's true, I did it for Sass, but some awesome contributors extended it to :
